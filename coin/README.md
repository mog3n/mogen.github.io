# Crypto Tracker
A simple coin tracker I built for myself. Feel free to modify this any way you like.

Includes clock for multiple time zones (namely UTC, TOK, and BEI) so you know the time in global markets. Added features such as price 1 day/week ago, and the 24 hour volume (most important factors imo). For daily trading, I've included a Ether to USD converter (I use this all the time) so I can compare the ratio between my alt coins to Ethereum.

API courtesy of CoinMarketCap.com, written in HTML/CSS, functionality of course, in JavaScript.
